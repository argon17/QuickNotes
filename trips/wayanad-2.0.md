#### **day 1:** **arrival at wayanad**

less crowded and decently scenic route, better than the mysore one

**bangalore → kanakapura → chamarajanagar → wayanad**

breakfast stop at kanakpura


#### **day 2 and day 3**

**don't have to stick to this, just a rough plan**

##### day 2:
- morning: karapuzha dam
- afternoon: random exploration around wayanad
- evening: banasura sagar dam

##### day 3:
- morning: chembra peak trek (or) glass bridge kandi
- afternoon: kanthanpara waterfalls (or) edakkal caves
- evening: pookede lake

**some really good places**
- kuruva dweep - little far, but i feel worth the exploration
- pakshipathalam - bird sanctuary and forest walking, again very far


#### **day 4: back to bangalore**
can take the same route
