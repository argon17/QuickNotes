# reactance theory  
- **reactance theory** suggests that when people perceive their freedom to choose or act is being restricted, they experience a motivational reaction to regain that freedom.  
- this leads to an increased desire to perform the restricted behavior, often as a way to restore a sense of autonomy.  

## examples  
- resisting a suggestion to quit smoking because it feels like an imposition, even if you are already considering quitting.  
- a teenager rebelling against parental curfews, not because they want to break the rules, but because the restriction challenges their sense of independence.  
- becoming more determined to buy a product after it is advertised as being "limited edition" or "selling out fast."
