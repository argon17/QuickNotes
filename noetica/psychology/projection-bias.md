# Projection Bias  
- The **projection bias** is a cognitive bias where people assume that others share their current thoughts, feelings, or preferences.  
- This bias can also lead individuals to project their present state onto future decisions, underestimating how much their preferences or circumstances might change.  

## Examples  
- Assuming everyone will enjoy a movie you loved, without considering different tastes.  
- Overestimating your future motivation to exercise based on how motivated you feel right now.  
- Stocking up on groceries while hungry, believing youâ€™ll want the same foods later.
