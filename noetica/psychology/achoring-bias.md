# anchoring bias  
- the **anchoring bias** is a cognitive bias where people rely too heavily on the first piece of information (the "anchor") when making decisions.  
- subsequent judgments are influenced by this initial reference point, even if it is irrelevant or misleading.  

## examples  
- during salary negotiations, the first number mentioned often sets the tone for the final agreement.  
- a retailer displaying a high original price next to a discounted price to make the discount seem more significant.
