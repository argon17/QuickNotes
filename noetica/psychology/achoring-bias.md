# Anchoring Bias  
- The **anchoring bias** is a cognitive bias where people rely too heavily on the first piece of information (the "anchor") when making decisions.  
- Subsequent judgments are influenced by this initial reference point, even if it is irrelevant or misleading.  

## Examples  
- During salary negotiations, the first number mentioned often sets the tone for the final agreement.  
- A retailer displaying a high original price next to a discounted price to make the discount seem more significant.
