# cognitive dissonance
- the **cognitive dissonance** is the mental discomfort people feel when holding two conflicting beliefs or attitudes
- people often change their beliefs or justify their actions to reduce discomfort.

## examples
- smoking while knowing the fact that it's bad for health
- eating meat while also knowing that it's ethically wrong to hurt animals
