# Cognitive Dissonance  
- **Cognitive dissonance** is the mental discomfort people feel when holding two conflicting beliefs or attitudes.  
- People often change their beliefs or justify their actions to reduce this discomfort.  

## Examples  
- Smoking while knowing the fact that it's bad for health.  
- Eating meat while also knowing that it's ethically wrong to hurt animals.
