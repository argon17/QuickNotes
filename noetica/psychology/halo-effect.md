# halo effect  
- the **halo effect** is a cognitive bias where our overall impression of a person influences how we perceive their other traits.  
- positive traits or behaviors can make us assume other unrelated positive qualities, and vice versa.  

## examples  
- assuming someone who is physically attractive is also intelligent or kind.  
- believing a confident speaker is more knowledgeable than they might actually be.  
- rating a hard-working employee as more skilled, even if their actual performance doesnâ€™t reflect it.
