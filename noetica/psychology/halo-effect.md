# Halo Effect  
- The **halo effect** is a cognitive bias where our overall impression of a person influences how we perceive their other traits.  
- Positive traits or behaviors can make us assume other unrelated positive qualities, and vice versa.  

## Examples  
- Assuming someone who is physically attractive is also intelligent or kind.  
- Believing a confident speaker is more knowledgeable than they might actually be.  
- Rating a hard-working employee as more skilled, even if their actual performance doesnâ€™t reflect it.
