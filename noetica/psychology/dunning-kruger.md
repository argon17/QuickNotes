# Dunning-Kruger Effect  
- The **Dunning-Kruger effect** is a cognitive bias where individuals with low competence in a domain overestimate their abilities, while experts often underestimate theirs.  
- This occurs because those with low skill lack the self-awareness to recognize their deficiencies.  

## Examples  
- A beginner in chess confidently challenging an experienced player, believing they are equally skilled.  
- An amateur coder claiming to create a groundbreaking app without understanding the complexities involved.
