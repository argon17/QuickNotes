# dunning-kruger effect  
- the **dunning-kruger effect** is a cognitive bias where individuals with low competence in a domain overestimate their abilities, while experts often underestimate theirs.  
- this occurs because those with low skill lack the self-awareness to recognize their deficiencies.  

## examples  
- a beginner in chess confidently challenging an experienced player, believing they are equally skilled.  
- an amateur coder claiming to create a groundbreaking app without understanding the complexities involved.
