# placebo effect  
- the **placebo effect** is a psychological phenomenon where people experience real improvements in their condition after receiving a treatment that has no active therapeutic properties.  
- this occurs due to the belief that the treatment will work, which can influence perception, behavior, and even physical responses.  

## examples  
- feeling pain relief after taking a sugar pill, believing it to be a painkiller.  
- improved athletic performance after drinking a beverage labeled as an "energy booster," even though itâ€™s just flavored water.
