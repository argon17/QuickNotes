# Spotlight Effect  
- The **spotlight effect** is the tendency to overestimate how much others notice or think about us.  
- This occurs because we are naturally more focused on ourselves than others are.  

## Examples  
- Imagining that others are judging a new outfit you wear, even though most people likely don't notice or care.  
- Feeling that a bad habit is obvious to everyone, leading to tension and anxiety.
