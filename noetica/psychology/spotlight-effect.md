# spotlight effect  
- the **spotlight effect** is the tendency to overestimate how much others notice or think about us.  
- this occurs because we are naturally more focused on ourselves than others are.  

## examples
- imagining that others are judging a new outfit you wear, even though most people likely don't notice or care.
- feeling that a bad habit is obvious to everyone, leading to tension and anxiety.
