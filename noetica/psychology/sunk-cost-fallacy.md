# sunk cost fallacy
the **sunk cost fallacy** is when people keep investing in something just because they’ve already invested time, money, or effort, even if it’s no longer worth it.

## key points
- **sunk costs**: money or effort already spent and can't be recovered.
- people often continue based on past investments, not future benefits.

## example
- watching a bad movie just because you’ve already watched 30 minutes of it.
