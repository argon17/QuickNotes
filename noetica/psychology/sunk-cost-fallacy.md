# Sunk Cost Fallacy  
- The **sunk cost fallacy** is when people keep investing in something just because they’ve already invested time, money, or effort, even if it’s no longer worth it.  
- **Sunk costs**: Money or effort already spent and can't be recovered.  

## Examples  
- Watching a bad movie just because you’ve already watched 30 minutes of it.  
- Continuing to eat a meal you don't enjoy just because you've already paid for it.  
- Staying in a long, unfulfilling relationship because you've already invested years into it.
