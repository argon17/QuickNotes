# sunk cost fallacy
- the **sunk cost fallacy** is when people keep investing in something just because they’ve already invested time, money, or effort, even if it’s no longer worth it.
- **sunk costs**: money or effort already spent and can't be recovered.

## examples
- watching a bad movie just because you’ve already watched 30 minutes of it.
- continuing to eat a meal you don't enjoy just because you've already paid for it.
- staying in a long, unfulfilling relationship because you've already invested years into it.
